# Exploring Expert Failures Improves LLM Agent Tuning (EEF)

This repository provides resources and insights based on the paper [Exploring Expert Failures Improves LLM Agent Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13145). The method introduced in this paper, termed Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), leverages beneficial actions from expert trajectories initially deemed unsuccessful, significantly improving the fine-tuning of Large Language Model (LLM) agents.

The expert trajectories dataset used in this paper is publicly available on Hugging Face at [lclan/webshop_expert_trajectories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lclan/webshop_expert_trajectories). This dataset comprises trajectories generated by GPT-3.5-turbo within the WebShop environment, capturing both successful and failed attempts, enabling research into advanced agent tuning methods that benefit from analyzing and learning from expert failures.
